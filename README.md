Student Grade Table (SGT) is a content management system (CMS) that allows the user to create, read, and delete student data from a MySQL database. SGT utilizes HTML5 to structure the page and Bootstrap for UI/UX and mobile-responsiveness. CSS3 was used to animate the glyphicon. JavaScript and jQuery were used to utilize DOM manipulation and AJAX calls were made to  retrieve data. SGT also utilizes a PHP script cron job to truncate and re-insert the table data every hour.
